Text File Synchroniser client:

A synchroniser for text based files that reside in multiple (VCS) repositories, available over HTTP(S).

Files are uniquely identified by groupId artefactId and version (just like with maven).
They will also have:

- url
- extension
- website
- name
- description
- storageType

The url is location of the file. The client downloads the file from this location.
